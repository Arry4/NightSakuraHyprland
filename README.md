First, back up your files!

Pur config files in their directiories, and if folder doesn't exist create one.

eg.

Hyprland config files go to:
~/.config/hypr

Waybar config files go to:
~/.config/waybar

wofi config files go to:
~/.config/wofi

fastfetch config files go to:
~/.config/fastfetch

etc.

What I remember installing :)  

cava  
fastfetch  
firefox - rice is configured to work with firefox and need changes in hyprland and waybar config files if other browser is used  
hypridle  
hyprlock  
hyprpolkitagent  
hyprsunset  
kitty  
pavucontol  
swaybg  
swaync  
thunar  
ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd  
waybar  
wofi  


To do after installation:

Change keyboard prefered input language in input.conf  
Change monitor, resolution, refresh rate and scaling in monitor.conf
